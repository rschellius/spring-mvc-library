Avans Spring Library Worked Example
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avansinformatica/spring-mvc-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avansinformatica/spring-mvc-library)

About
----------------
This is a worked example of a library case that is used at [Avans Hogeschool](http://www.avans.nl) in Breda, Netherlands. Some of the content in the app is in Dutch.

It uses the following technologies:

- Spring Boot MVC with Maven
- Thymeleaf templating engine with Java 8 Time
- MySql database using plain old SQL queries, so without JPA/Hibernate.
- WebJars for css and js includes
- [maven-git-commit-id-plugin](https://github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin) to display Git commit info in our Spring application footer
- Swagger to describe the (minimal) REST API 
- MockMVC tests
- [Travis CI](http://https://travis-ci.org) for automatic test CI
